#transaction_diamond_First_purchase =125 customers vs #transaction_diamond_overall_purchase = 930 customers

Transcation = 13.4408602% | revenue = 13.44086 % 

Is there a correlation here with number of games they have played or their coin balance at   time of purchase?

Are there any patterns here?

- At what point do spenders stop paying?

- Is there a pattern that drives those users who purchase the more expensive coin bundles?
